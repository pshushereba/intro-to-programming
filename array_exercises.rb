# To print "example", you use puts arr[1][0]

  # 1. Returns the index of the number 5, which is 3

  # 2. Throws an error.

  # 3. Returns the value 8

  # a = "e"
  # b = "A"
  # c = nil -> There is nothing at 19 index

  # The problem is that you cannot use a string to select an array
  # index. You can fix the error by using the index where the string,
  # in this case a name is located.
